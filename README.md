# vbdcast: Vector-borne disease forecasting

### Phenomenological forecasting of dengue outbreaks

This repository primarily contains supplementary material for [Johnson, et al (2016) "Phenomenological forecasting of disease incidence using heteroskedastic
Gaussian processes: a dengue case study"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00261).  

The directory structure is explained as follows.  In each case, see the README therein for more details.

* `code`: source files for hetGP and GLM comparators in the R language for statistical computing. 

* `data`: pre-processed data files from the [Dengue Forecasting Project](http://dengueforecasting.noaa.gov/)

* `results`: pdf-based visualizations for GP and GLM-based figures, a subset of which are provided in the manuscript.
