"Phenomenological forecasting of disease incidence using heteroskedastic
Gaussian processes: a dengue case study" contains versions of the pdf files
produced by the R code in the examples sub-directory.  Of particular interest
may be iquitos.pdf and sanjuan.pdf are the "movies" referenced in the main
manuscript.  These are produced by wrappying a pdf command around a
source-execution of gp_dengue_iquitos.R and gp_dengue_sanjuan.R, respectively.
